# Sort
Some sorting algorithms I created in C

Supports merge sort, parallelized merge sort, insertion sort, selection sort and bubble sort. 

Include "sort.h" at the top of your program and use -
merge_sort(array, array length); for merge sort
insertion_sort(array, ARRAY_SIZE);  for insertion sort
selection_sort(array, ARRAY_SIZE); for selection sort
